# Matrix-Transformations
In this project, I practiced using matrix multiplication to transform data efficiently. The different transformations that I implemented are translation, scaling, and rotation. The project entailed creating a Transformation class and using it to find transformations that generate certain plots of the Iris dataset and uncover hidden letters in a 3D dataset.
